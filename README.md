As part of the course "Mathematics with a Computer", I am implementing the Functional encryption scheme for computing inner products by Abdalla, Bourse, De Caro and Pointcheval that is based on the DDH assumption.
The group of choice is the quadratic residue subgroup modulo a safe-prime and the programming lanugage of choice is C++ using the Crypto++ library.
